Heart 

Aorta

Lung  is not cvery clear 



Most of the case its one organ


Multi organs 

Boundary may be bit  hard 


Boundary loss function  

Training data of heart and liver 


Could be similar 


Liver alone ----  A + B 
A is heart 

B is liver 


remove liver 



Idea::: 

SIngle organ - loss function - only for the liver 


Multi orgna - loss function - both heart and liver so more loss 

Loss function of A + Los function of B 



better loss function - results 


Loss function is not good enough / parameter tuning can also bad 


After loss function - converge  - yes or not 

Uf yes then 


Tranfer learning - already learnt some data 0 you leverage it 



Train heart 
512*512  = 400  data size 
Train liver 
512*512 = 300 data size 
Train pancreas 
All 3d


Then loss function joint 


Loss function -find the library 



Change of the architecture

how we can change the loss function 

unet,vnet 

Check forums 



no change in augumentation 




Loss function -
